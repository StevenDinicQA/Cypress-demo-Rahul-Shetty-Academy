Cypress demo Rahul Shetty Academy

This repository is my take on the Rahul Shetty's Academy website and automation practice segment of the same website.

The project is done in Cypress, with the OOP-like structure. It is consisted of:
  1. Selectors that are in a .json file
  2. Locators where the selectors are put into variables, located in the services
  3. Steps for the logic of each test, also located in the services
  4. Tests that are structured for separate functions, located in the tests/UI tests
  5. Test data that is located in the fixtures
  6. package.json and cypress.config.js that have all the plugins and setup for the browser
